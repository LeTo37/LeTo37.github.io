                    <img src="img/LeviT.png" width="58%" align="middle"><h3>Brief Overview </h3> My name is Levi Todes, I was born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa. I grew up, as do many Cape Townians, in love with the outdoors and more often than not you can find me enjoying the Mountains and Oceans that Cape Town provides!
                    I did my undergraduate in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Cape Town before heading to Chicago, USA to complete my Masters in Robotics Engineering at Northwestern University. I then spent some time working in a Mechatronics Design role that taught me a lot about electro-mechanical design of robots as a product. This role spanned embedded software engineering and design, mechanical design as well as basic electrical design. 
                    <br>
                    I am now back home in Cape Town looking for interesting roles that will challenge me and allow me learn new skills. I am particularly looking for roles involving Embedded Software as I believe I have both a lot to contribute as well as learn in that area!

                	<p><h3>What I am up to at the moment </h3> I am currently still completing my Masters degree. The courses I have taken include<span>&#58;</span> Embedded Systems, Robotic Manipulation, Machine Dynamics, Computational Photography, Introduction to Mechatronics, Introduction to Feedback Systems, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, Advanced Mechatronics, Geospatial Vision and Visualization and Machine Learning-Foundations, Applications, and Algorithms. 
                    <br>I recently spent the summer first working as a research assistant in the Neurocscience and Robotics Laboratory at Northwestern.<br> Following that I worked as a Robotics Engineering Intern at Trossen Robotics where my roles included assisting with ROS architechture, ROS implementation and CAD for Robotic arms.
                    <br> <h4>Current Projects</h4> As part of the final quarter of my masters degree my final project is under the supervision of Professor Dan Brown. The project involves the automation of a manufacturing process for a product called the Bionic Wrench. More information about the project will be posted as it happens over <a href=https://github.com/LeTo37/Bionic_Wrench_Automation_Project style="color:#000000;" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
