I grew up in Cape Town which means I spent a lot of time outdoors. I enjoy most sports and outdoor activities, with a particular interest in Football, Hiking, Surfing, Cricket, Rugby, Golf and Cycling. I moved to Chicago in August 2018 and am currently completing my Masters in Robotics at Northwestern University. I did my undergraduate degree in mechatronics at the University of Cape Town and I particularly enjoy digital electronics, programming and creating things with my hands!<br></p>

The courses I have taken include<span>&#58;</span> Embedded Systems, Robotic Manipulation, Machine Dynamics, Computational Photography, Introduction to Mechatronics, Introduction to Feedback Systems, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles, Advanced Mechatronics, Geospatial Vision and Visualization and Machine Learning-Foundations, Applications, and Algorithms. 
                    <br>I recently spent the summer first working as a research assistant in the Neurocscience and Robotics Laboratory at Northwestern.<br> Following that I worked as a Robotics Engineering Intern at Trossen Robotics where my roles included assisting with ROS architechture, ROS implementation and CAD for Robotic arms.
                    <br> <h4>Current Projects</h4> As part of the final quarter of my masters degree my final project is under the supervision of Professor Dan Brown. The project involves the automation of a manufacturing process for a product called the Bionic Wrench. More information about the project will be posted as it happens over <a href=https://github.com/LeTo37/Bionic_Wrench_Automation_Project style="color:#FFFFFF;">here.</a></p>
