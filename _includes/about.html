                    <h3>Brief Overview </h3> My name is Levi Todes, I was born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa. I grew up, as do many Cape Townians, in love with the outdoors and more often than not you can find me enjoying the Mountains and Oceans that Cape Town provides!
                    I did my undergraduate in Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Cape Town before heading to Chicago, USA to complete my Masters in Robotics Engineering at Northwestern University. I then spent some time working in a Mechatronics Design role that taught me a lot about electro-mechanical design of robots as a product. This role spanned embedded software engineering and design, mechanical design as well as basic electrical design. 
                    <br></p>

                    <p><h3>Looking Forward! </h3> 
                     I am now back home in Cape Town looking for interesting roles that will challenge me and allow me learn new skills. I am particularly looking for roles involving Embedded Software as I believe I have both a lot to contribute as well as learn in that area!
